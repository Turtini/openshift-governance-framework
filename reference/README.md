# Reference Alignment Notes

This directory provides narrative alignment artifacts connecting governance enforcement patterns to federal compliance expectations and authorization durability considerations.

The purpose of these documents is not to replicate control catalogs or SSP templates. Instead, they demonstrate how technical enforcement mechanisms reinforce documented governance intent.

These notes are intended to support structured conversations between:

- Platform engineering teams
- Security and compliance stakeholders
- Authorizing officials
- Institutional leadership

Technical enforcement strengthens compliance defensibility when it aligns with documented intent and observable system behavior.
