# OpenShift Governance Framework

This repository provides structured governance artifacts and reference configuration patterns aligned with regulated OpenShift operating models in federal environments.

It complements the white paper *Operating OpenShift as a Regulated Platform* and is intended to support platform engineers, security stakeholders, and architects seeking to operationalize authorization durability, continuous monitoring discipline, and lifecycle governance within mission-critical institutions.

The materials included here are not turnkey deployment scripts. They are illustrative reference patterns designed to demonstrate enforceable governance boundaries, declarative configuration alignment, and operational traceability.

---

## Purpose

The objective of this framework is to reinforce structural alignment between:

- Governance intent  
- Technical enforcement  
- Monitoring and evidence generation  
- Lifecycle management  
- Authorization sustainability  

Rather than focusing on product capability alone, this repository emphasizes operating model depth and institutional coherence.

---

## Intended Use

These artifacts are designed to be adapted to organizational policy, risk tolerance, and lifecycle strategy. They are not prescriptive implementations, but structured examples aligned with regulated OpenShift environments.

---

## Alignment

All patterns and examples in this repository are informed by:

- Red Hat architectural guidance  
- Federal compliance expectations under FISMA  
- Practical implementation experience in public sector environments  

The purpose of this framework is to advance governance maturity and institutional stability in dynamic OpenShift deployments.
