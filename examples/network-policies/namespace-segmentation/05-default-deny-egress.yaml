# Purpose:
#   Establish a baseline egress segmentation posture by default-denying egress traffic.
#
# Context:
#   Default-deny egress reduces the likelihood of unintended data exfiltration paths and forces
#   explicit definition of allowed outbound communication (DNS, logging, dependencies).
#
# Notes:
#   - Apply per namespace.
#   - This policy denies all egress unless explicitly allowed by additional policies.
#   - Introduce allow rules deliberately to avoid operational disruption.
