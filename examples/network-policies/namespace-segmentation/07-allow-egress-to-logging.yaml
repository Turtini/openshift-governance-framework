# Purpose:
#   Allow egress from workloads to centralized logging components within the cluster.
#
# Context:
#   Many logging architectures require workloads to send logs or telemetry to in-cluster collectors
#   (directly or indirectly). Under default-deny egress, this traffic must be explicitly permitted.
#
# Notes:
#   - Adapt namespaces to match your logging stack (e.g., openshift-logging, logging).
#   - Consider further narrowing using podSelector and ports once collector endpoints are standardized.
#   - This example demonstrates the pattern; institutions should tailor to their architecture.
