# Purpose:
#   Baseline namespace segmentation policy that default-denies ingress traffic.
#
# Context:
#   Regulated OpenShift environments benefit from explicit, enforceable segmentation boundaries.
#   Default-deny ingress forces allowed communication paths to be documented and encoded.
#
# Notes:
#   - Apply per namespace.
#   - This does not restrict egress traffic.
#   - Introduce explicit allow policies as needed (ingress controller, monitoring, inter-service calls).
