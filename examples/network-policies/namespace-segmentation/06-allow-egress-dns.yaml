# Purpose:
#   Allow egress to cluster DNS so workloads can resolve service names.
#
# Context:
#   In default-deny egress environments, DNS resolution must be explicitly permitted.
#   Without DNS, most applications will fail even when all other dependencies are available.
#
# Notes:
#   - This example targets OpenShift DNS running in `openshift-dns`.
#   - Pod labels may vary by OpenShift version and configuration; adapt selectors as needed.
#   - DNS uses UDP/TCP 53.
