# Purpose:
#   Illustrative cluster-scoped RBAC roles aligned with regulated OpenShift governance models.
#
# Context:
#   Regulated environments benefit from separating platform governance responsibilities from application operations.
#   This example demonstrates a governance-oriented role that avoids broad cluster-admin usage.
#
# Notes:
#   - This is NOT a complete role set.
#   - Organizations must adapt rules, approvals, and group mappings to institutional policy.
#   - The goal is to demonstrate responsibility boundaries, not enumerate every permission required.
