# Purpose:
#   Illustrative namespace-scoped RBAC roles aligned with application operations in regulated OpenShift environments.
#
# Context:
#   Application teams should generally be empowered to manage workloads within a namespace boundary,
#   while platform-level governance is retained at the cluster level.
#
# Notes:
#   - This example is intentionally minimal.
#   - Add verbs/resources based on organizational workload standards and risk tolerance.
