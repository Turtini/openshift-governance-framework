# Purpose:
#   Illustrative role bindings demonstrating how responsibilities can be assigned to distinct identity groups.
#
# Context:
#   Separation of duties is reinforced when bindings align to institutional identity groups.
#   This pattern demonstrates the concept without prescribing group naming conventions.
#
# Notes:
#   - Replace group names with your IdP-backed groups.
#   - Consider change management controls around binding modifications.
