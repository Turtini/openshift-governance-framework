# Examples

This directory contains structured reference examples that illustrate governance patterns for regulated OpenShift environments.

These examples are not turnkey deployment assets. They are designed to demonstrate enforceable boundaries, traceable configuration, and operating-model alignment in a way that can be adapted to institutional policy and risk tolerance.

Each example includes a README describing:

- Purpose and context
- What the pattern enforces
- Common pitfalls and adaptation guidance
- How the example connects back to the governance model and white paper
