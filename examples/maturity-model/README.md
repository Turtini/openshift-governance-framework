# Platform Maturity Model

This directory expands upon the platform maturity model described in the white paper *Operating OpenShift as a Regulated Platform*.

The objective of this model is diagnostic clarity. It is designed to help institutions identify their current operating posture and define a deliberate progression path.

This model does not measure technical sophistication alone. It evaluates structural alignment between:

- Governance intent
- Enforceable configuration
- Monitoring discipline
- Lifecycle management
- Authorization durability

Maturity reflects institutional coherence, not feature adoption.
