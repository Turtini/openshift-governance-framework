# Purpose:
#   Illustrative admission policy enforcing approved container registries.
#
# Context:
#   Regulated OpenShift environments often require workloads to source container images
#   from institutionally approved registries to reduce supply chain risk.
#
# Notes:
#   - This example assumes use of a policy engine such as Kyverno.
#   - Adapt registry domains and namespace scope to institutional standards.
#   - Test thoroughly before enforcing in production environments.
