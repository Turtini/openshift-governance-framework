# Lifecycle Governance and Upgrade Discipline

OpenShift platforms operate within defined vendor support lifecycles. Governance maturity requires deliberate upgrade planning and change management.

---

## Upgrade Cadence

Organizations should define:

- Supported version policy
- Upgrade testing procedures
- Rollback strategies
- Change communication protocols

Upgrade discipline reduces volatility and preserves authorization alignment.

---

## Change Traceability

All configuration changes should be:

- Version-controlled
- Reviewed prior to implementation
- Linked to documented governance intent

Traceable change strengthens both operational stability and audit defensibility.

---

## Sustaining Authorization Through Change

Authorization durability depends on maintaining alignment between:

- Documented controls
- Enforceable configuration
- Observed platform behavior

Lifecycle governance ensures that change reinforces, rather than undermines, institutional coherence.
